# Image Segmentation and Object Detection Project

This repository contains implementations of image segmentation and object detection techniques using Jupyter Notebooks. The project demonstrates methods for segmenting images and detecting objects from scratch using machine learning models.

## Files

- `Image Segmentation.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for performing image segmentation on sample data.
- `YOLO Object Detection from Scratch.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook implementing YOLO for object detection from scratch.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuchismita-anwar/Image-Segmentation.git
